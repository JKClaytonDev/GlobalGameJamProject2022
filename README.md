Submission for 2022 Global Game Jam.

Play as Saul Slapman, the greatest slapper in the world, in his emotional journey to stop the public from drinking Slap Soda. Saul understands the heavy burden he carries because of his slapping abilities and knows the world-ending possibilities mass-producing such a dangerous drink would lead to. Use your left hand to slap the opposition and your right hand to fling a sticky hand and grapple onto objects.

This is a project created by Jackson Clayton, Frazier Kyle, and Jelani McKenzie
